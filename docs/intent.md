This document reframes each article in terms of authorial intent, audience motive, and reader outcome, then proposes a stronger, specific rewrite action. The aim is to make each piece read as deliberate craft rather than a descriptive stub.

Start Here: Building the Tool While Using It exists to orient a new reader and to make the method feel tangible rather than philosophical. The audience is someone arriving cold, and the intended outcome is clarity about how to navigate the archive as a living build log. The current ending names the series but does not yet instruct a reader how to use it. Rewrite action: finish with a direct, two‑sentence instruction that points to the genesis series as the main path and names the first two links as the reader’s next step, so the intent becomes a map rather than a claim.

Why I’m Building This in Public exists to defend public writing as an engineering method and to justify the vulnerability that comes with it. The audience is sceptical readers who view public diaries as noise. The intended outcome is respect for the practice as a decision tool, not a performance. The piece already has one example, but it sits mid‑stream and feels incidental. Rewrite action: add a short, concrete second example at the end that shows a visible change in the repo caused by writing, so the intent becomes cumulative evidence.

Writing Fast Without Writing Sloppily exists to reconcile speed with craft and to show that constraints can preserve voice. The audience is writers who assume pace requires compromise. The intended outcome is trust that the process can stay human even when assisted by tooling. The “prose‑lint” paragraph is good but still abstract. Rewrite action: add a single, named failure pattern and a brief before/after sentence pair that shows how the tool changes a draft, making the intent demonstrable.

An Article Is a File exists to define the atomic unit and to make durability feel concrete. The audience is technical readers who need a stable model to reason about. The intended outcome is understanding that the file system is not a convenience, it is the archive contract. The article already explains the structure but does not explicitly connect it to reader trust. Rewrite action: add one sentence after the YAML example that states how this guarantees permalinks and lets a reader trust an old link, so the intent moves from structure to promise.

The Article Body exists to defend the reader surface and keep the narrative separate from build logic. The audience is anyone who expects Markdown to be readable without tooling. The intended outcome is confidence that the writing stands on its own. The close is strong but drifts into system language. Rewrite action: replace the final two sentences with a direct commitment to the reader that the body will remain readable even if the build disappears, keeping the intent human‑facing.

Assets exists to prevent media sprawl and to keep attachments portable. The audience is future contributors adding images. The intended outcome is a habit of keeping assets local so the archive remains intact. The piece already explains mechanics but could lean harder into portability. Rewrite action: add a sentence after the folder example that says a clone is complete by default, so the intent is framed as a portability guarantee rather than a rule.

Frontmatter as Data exists to separate machine data from prose and to keep indexing deterministic. The audience is readers trying to understand how queries work. The intended outcome is trust that lists do not scrape prose or invent meaning. The article explains the table model but does not state why that protects voice. Rewrite action: add a line in the last paragraph that names the benefit explicitly, such as keeping the body’s tone untouched by index logic, so the intent is about authorial control.

Series and Tags in Time exists to teach navigation intent: when to follow a sequence and when to browse a topic. The audience is a reader deciding how to approach the archive. The intended outcome is that series read as a narrative and tags read as topical updates. The last line already gives guidance but feels brief. Rewrite action: expand that closing sentence into a short, two‑sentence directive that clarifies the reader’s choice and suggests that series are for story while tags are for status.

Indexing as Queries exists to defend a declarative selection model and to keep templates mechanical. The audience is technical readers who might expect templating logic. The intended outcome is a clear mental model: queries select, templates stamp. The piece already covers the constraint, but the motive could be sharper. Rewrite action: add a single sentence after the “no DSL” paragraph that names the failure the rule prevents, such as hidden selection or impossible debugging, so the intent is about accountability.

A Blog That Is Also the Build System exists to connect philosophy with mechanics and to show why the repo is the journal. The audience is readers who need the conceptual hinge, not just the plumbing. The intended outcome is the ability to inspect the system by reading the archive. The last paragraph gestures at this, but the reader is not directly addressed. Rewrite action: add a sentence that explicitly invites the reader to trace a decision through the file tree, making the intent participatory.

Blog Philosophy exists to state the non‑negotiables and make the project legible as a stance rather than a feature list. The audience is anyone trying to understand the boundaries. The intended outcome is that the reader sees a clear line between acceptable evolution and drift. The close is good but could be firmer. Rewrite action: add a final sentence that states the cost of violating the philosophy in concrete terms, such as losing trust in the archive or breaking the promise to readers.

Why Websites Need Templates exists to give the first step of the templating series and to ground the reader before critique. The audience is readers unfamiliar with static publishing mechanics. The intended outcome is understanding that templates solve duplication and consistency. The article already hints at the next piece, but the author’s system is only implied. Rewrite action: insert a short bridge sentence before the final paragraph that names the “stamp” model as the reason the series exists, so the intent is explicit.

When Templates Start Making Decisions exists to show how logic inside templates erodes predictability. The audience is readers accustomed to templating engines. The intended outcome is scepticism about mixing selection with structure. The article already names the risk, but the author’s personal motive is muted. Rewrite action: add a sentence that states the point at which you stop trusting the output, making the intent emotional and technical at once.

Templates as Mechanical Stamps exists to present the alternative model and make it visible. The audience is readers who now accept the problem and want the solution. The intended outcome is confidence that templates can be read like documents and still produce reliable pages. The example does most of the work. Rewrite action: add a closing sentence that states what you want the reader to feel when they open a template file, turning the example into a reader‑centric payoff.

Owning Your Output exists to frame self‑publishing as a technical choice rather than a lifestyle. The audience is people who publish on platforms out of convenience. The intended outcome is a desire to own the surface and keep writing durable. The article could tie more tightly back to the project. Rewrite action: add a line in the final paragraph that says this is why you are building the system instead of posting elsewhere, which will make the intent explicit and project‑specific.

Reclaiming the Web’s Original Spirit exists to connect the historical ethic of open protocols to present design choices. The audience is readers who did not live through the early web. The intended outcome is belief that openness still matters and can be acted on. The piece ends on principle but not on action. Rewrite action: add a closing line that links the history to a concrete constraint in this project, such as refusing closed templates or platform‑bound formats, so the intent becomes current.

Your Address Is Your Domain exists to argue that domain ownership is the primary unit of independence. The audience is readers who treat domains as optional. The intended outcome is a practical decision to own the address before publishing. The current ending is strong but could be more directive. Rewrite action: add one sentence that turns the metaphor into a reader action, such as “own the address before you build the house,” to make the intent explicitly prescriptive.

Rework priority: none require deletion, but the two most vulnerable if you want to prune hard are Assets and Frontmatter as Data because they are implementation‑heavy. If you keep them, the rewrite actions above should anchor them in reader‑visible intent rather than internal rules.
