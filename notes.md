Your Address Is Your Domain

When you publish on a platform, you are borrowing an address. Your writing lives under someone else’s name on someone else’s domain, and it stays there only as long as that company allows. You can share the link, but you do not control it because the ground your words stand on is not yours.

the language is weird
You can share the link, but you do not control it because the ground your words stand on is not yours.

mixed metaphor, words do not stand on ground, a surface maybe 
fix metaphor issues with whole article


===============

Tags: describe subject matter and collect material that shares a topic without implying sequence. A reader who clicks a tag expects to see what is most recent first, since recency tends to track relevance. Tag pages group by tag and sort by date descending. Older entries remain available, but they do not define the view.

this gets formatted as links

<p>Tags: <a href="/tags/describe subject matter and collect material that shares a topic without implying sequence. a reader who clicks a tag expects to see what is most recent first/">describe subject matter and collect material that shares a topic without implying sequence. A reader who clicks a tag expects to see what is most recent first</a>, <a href="/tags/since recency tends to track relevance. tag pages group by tag and sort by date descending. older entries remain available/">since recency tends to track relevance. Tag pages group by tag and sort by date descending. Older entries remain available</a>, <a href="/tags/but they do not define the view./">but they do not define the view.</a></p>

can we fix?
