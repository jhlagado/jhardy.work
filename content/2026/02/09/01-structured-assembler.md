title: What Makes ZAX a Structured Assembler? Design Principles and Goals

description: An exploration of ZAX’s structured assembler philosophy, its design motivations, and the features that distinguish it from traditional assembly tools.

ZAX is not just another assembler. It is a deliberate reimagining of what low-level programming can be, shaped by the conviction that clarity and structure are not luxuries—they are necessities. The project began with a simple question: what if assembly could be as readable and maintainable as modern high-level languages, without sacrificing the directness and control that make it powerful?

At its core, ZAX is built around the idea that structure matters. Instead of treating assembly as a loose collection of instructions, ZAX organizes code into functions, contracts, and data layouts. This approach brings order to complexity, making it possible to reason about programs as coherent units rather than scattered fragments.

The design goals are ambitious but grounded. ZAX aims to:

- Make assembly code safer, by providing strong diagnostics and clear error messages.
- Encourage maintainability, through explicit contracts and type annotations.
- Support modularity, allowing code to be composed and reused across projects.
- Preserve the spirit of classic Z80 assembly, while opening the door to new programming patterns.

Every feature in ZAX is chosen to serve these goals. Structured control flow, robust data definitions, and a focus on readable syntax are not afterthoughts—they are the foundation. The result is an assembler that feels familiar to veterans, yet welcoming to newcomers. ZAX is a tool for those who want to write code that lasts, and for those who believe that even the lowest levels of software deserve clarity.
