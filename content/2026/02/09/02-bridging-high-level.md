title: How ZAX Bridges High-Level Language Features and Classic Assembly

description: A look at how ZAX combines modern programming concepts with traditional Z80 assembly, making low-level code more expressive and accessible.

ZAX stands at the intersection of two worlds: the precision of classic assembly and the expressiveness of high-level languages. This is not a compromise—it is a synthesis. By weaving contracts, types, and structured control flow into the fabric of Z80 assembly, ZAX transforms what was once arcane into something approachable.

Contracts in ZAX are more than documentation. They define expectations, clarify intent, and provide a safety net for both the author and the reader. Types are not just labels; they are guides that shape how data moves through a program, reducing ambiguity and preventing subtle errors.

Structured control flow is where ZAX truly shines. Instead of relying on scattered jumps and labels, ZAX offers constructs like select and case, making branching logic explicit and readable. The result is code that tells a story, not just a sequence of operations.

This bridge between high-level and low-level is not built for its own sake. It is a response to the needs of modern developers, who demand both power and clarity. ZAX invites you to write assembly that is not only correct, but also comprehensible. It is a tool for those who want to understand their code, and for those who want their code to be understood.
