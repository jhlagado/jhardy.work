In the early 1990s, when Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues were shaping the World Wide Web, the core idea was simple: this network is for everyone. The web was meant to be a place where anyone could publish, link, and share on their own terms. Before social media and platform lock-in, that idea felt direct and practical.

The web’s original promise rested on open protocols and a light technical burden. HTTP and HTML were open enough for anyone to implement, and small enough to understand. If you wanted to publish, you bought a domain, wrote a page, and put it online. There was no gatekeeper and no opaque algorithm deciding who saw your work.

Convenience platforms changed the bargain. They offered instant audiences and effortless publishing, and that made sense for a long time. I used them too. The cost is that your writing lives inside someone else’s system, and your visibility depends on their incentives. The surface looks open, but the platform owns it.

This still matters because a personal site is a form of self-reliance. When you own the domain and the files, you also own the story you are telling. You can publish without asking, you can keep an archive that outlives a platform, and you can link in ways that stay stable.

Nostalgia is not the point here. I want to keep the original contract intact: open standards, durable URLs, and independent publishing. That is the ground I want to stand on while I build this site.
