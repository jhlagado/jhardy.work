# Reclaiming the Classic Web

_January 12, 2026_ | Series: open-web | Tags: web, philosophy, self-publishing, open-protocols

I keep coming back to the early web because it solved a human problem with a simple technical shape. Tim Berners-Lee gave people a set of open protocols and a way to link documents without permission from anyone else. The promise was the quiet power of being able to publish, link, and be found without asking.

In the early 1990s, that promise felt direct. A page was a page. A URL meant something stable. HTML was plain enough that anyone could read it, and HTTP was open enough that anyone could build a server. The system moved text and links between people who were willing to host their own work.

That spirit is easy to forget because convenience won the next phase. Social platforms made publishing effortless, and for a while I used them because they removed the labour of building and hosting. The cost is real. Platforms own the surface. They decide what stays visible and what disappears. Your writing remains present only while it serves someone else’s machine.

Self-publishing is how I step back into the original contract. Owning a domain and shipping plain HTML is a technical stance. It keeps the work accessible without a login, readable without a platform, and durable enough to outlive the tooling that made it. It also keeps the archive honest. A page I host will still exist tomorrow if I decide it should.

This is the first piece in a series about that return. I want to write about the web as a public medium again, not as a product surface. Open protocols, stable URLs, and personal publishing still work. They are available now, and I plan to build with those constraints so the writing stays mine and the system stays open to anyone who wants to read or fork it.
